# Object-Constructor-Practice
This repository contains an exersize to practice object constructors. The instructions were:
    
    1. Create a constructor function called Tree. It should take 4 arguments that correspond to attributes on the objects it creates. Two attributes should be 'name' and 'leaf shape'. Pick the other two. 

    2. Create 4 tree objects using your Tree function.

    3. Put those objects into an array called tree_array. 

    4. for each tree in tree_array, add a block element to the tree-holder div that displays the tree's attributes
